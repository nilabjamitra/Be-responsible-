# Be-responsible-: Responsible Slot Machine Gambling

This project is a simple, text-based slot machine game written in Python to demonstrate core programming concepts like functions, loops, user input validation, randomness, and basic game mechanics.

Important: Gamble Responsibly
- This code is for educational and entertainment purposes only.
- Gambling can be addictive and may lead to financial and personal harm.
- Only play with money you can afford to lose.
- Set limits before you start (time and money) and stick to them.
- Never chase losses. Take breaks and stop when it’s no longer fun.
- If you feel gambling is becoming a problem, seek help immediately.

Help and Resources
- India: Resources may vary by state; consider mental health helplines and counseling services.
- International: Gamblers Anonymous (https://www.gamblersanonymous.org/ga/), BeGambleAware (https://www.begambleaware.org/), National Council on Problem Gambling (US) (https://www.ncpgambling.org/).

How the Game Works
- Deposit an initial balance.
- Choose how many lines to bet on (1 to 3).
- Choose your bet per line (between the configured min and max).
- The game spins a 3x3 grid with symbols that have different frequencies and payout values.
- If all symbols match across a selected line, you win according to symbol value × bet.
- Your balance updates after each spin.

Run Locally
1) Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2) Clone the repository or download the files.
3) From the project root, run:
   python "Be Responsible/main.py"

File Structure
